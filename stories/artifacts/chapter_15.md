# 15: The Prison

Owen woke up with a start. He had been having the dream again. 

For the last week or so every night he’d dreamt that he was walking through a forest when a door opened in the air next to him and he was grabbed and pulled through by tremendously strong hands. After the door closed he found himself in total darkness.

The dream had grown less vivid over time. The first time he had dreamt it it had felt real, visceral, and horrifying. That first day he was sure it had really happened. Now though, after more nights, he wasn't so sure.

The thing that kept him wondering if maybe it _had_ been real, is that he couldn’t figure out any other way that he would have ended up in this stupid prison cell. He had no memory of walking here, or getting kidnapped, or anything. He remembered walking with Luke and Joel and Austin, trying to get away from something, and then... nothing.

He sat up in his bed, which seemed pretty comfortable for a prison, he thought. He walked to the door and looked down the hallway to see if there was any light at the end of it; that was the only way he could tell if it was day or night. An amber glow illuminated the hall slightly, far away, implying sunrise. The breakfast on the floor confirmed it.

He ate the breakfast, which seemed good for prison food, and wondered what the day would hold. So far, every day, just after breakfast, a visitor had come to ask him questions that he didn’t know the answer to, and every day Owen would demand to know exactly where he was, why he was still in prison. So far his questions had all gone unanswered. 

He was just finishing his orange juice when he heard the footsteps in the hall. He took a deep breath and leaned against the wall, waiting for the inevitable. The footsteps grew louder as the interrogator neared his cell. As the steps came to a halt at the door, a panel slid open, and a now-familiar voice spoke.

“Good morning, Owen,” the interrogator said. The voice was deep and gravely. No matter how hard Owen tried he couldn’t see a face; the interrogator wore a hood, and the space were a head should be just looked like inky blackness.

“Hey,” Owen replied. “This prison sucks. Let me out.”

“You know I’d love to do that, Owen, but you still haven’t answered my questions.”

Owen scoffed. “That’s because I don’t know the answer to your questions. Are you stupid, or what?”

The man sighed. His voice lowered. “Let’s not bother with this again today. You know much more than you say, and you’re going to tell me. My spies confirmed to me this morning that your friends are meeting with council members already. I will soon know the details of their plans. If you want them to survive the next two days, you’ll tell me all that you know. _Tell me_.”

As the man said the words, “Tell me,” Owen could feel his head swim, like when you jump off the merry-go-round at the park. His stomach lurched, and he had a sudden urge to spill his guts to the man. But as quickly as the feel started, Owen pushed it away. He shook his head to clear it.

“I’ve already told you everything. My friends and I were in the forest, we found some old junk, and wandered down the wrong path and ended up here. We’d be very happy just to go back home. Now open this dang door and let me out!”

The man moved closer to the door, and the hair on the back of Owen’s neck stood up. His voice was now as low and guttural a voice as Owen had ever heard, still emanating from the inky black voice beneath the hood. He spoke slowly, one word at a time. “Tell. Me. Why. You. Are. Here.”

“Dude, shut the heck up,” Owen spat.

There was a brief pause, then it felt to Owen as if the ground was beginning to rumble, first far away, then closer and closer. At the same time a tingling sensation began at his feet and slowly rose across his skin to the top of his scalp — electric, like the feeling right before you touch a friend with a huge static shock.  And then his head began to swim again, this time with a fury he hadn’t felt before. His stomach churned, and his head began to ache at the temples, when suddenly it felt like the electricity on his body discharged, and a door opened in his mind. He could see the interrogator clearly there: the large cloaked figure with inky blackness where the head should be. He was illuminated as though a single spotlight were on him in the midst of an empty stage. He walked forward, what seemed like closer. There was no sound in the prison cell, but Owen heard the voice clearly.

“I didn’t want to have to do this, Owen. But if you won’t tell me what you know, I’m going to have to come get the information myself.”

“Get the heck out of my head, you monster!” Owen yelled. “Get. Out. Of. My. Head!”

A lantern emerged from the cloak, though no hand held it, and illuminated the space around the man. Bookshelves came into view, endless rows of them, and the man leaned in, reading the spines. Owen wasn’t sure how he knew, but he was positive that these were his memories.

“No!” Owen shouted. In his mind he lunged at the man, but his feet were bound, and he tripped and fell. The man’s cloak turned, and he chuckled, but kept looking at the books. Owen struggled against the ropes, but couldn’t free himself. He pulled as hard as he could, but the ropes just seemed to get tighter.

By the shelves, the man seemed to find something interesting, and a book slid off the shelf and opened itself in mid-air. The cloak turned side-to-side a bit, as though the head that should be there were reading. Then the book snapped shut and fell to the ground. He bent back over the books and continued his search.

“Get out of my head!” Owen shouted. “Get out of my...” and then he realized it. They were in _his_ head. Somehow, whatever magic, or power, or weird static electric effect this was, they were inside _Owen’s_ head. Which meant, that this was his own imagination - he could control it. 

Just to test his theory, he closed his eyes and concentrated, then opened them again and looked at his ankles. The ropes were gone - he was free. He was free, but he still wasn’t sure how to get the interrogator out of his mind. But, he did have an idea about how to keep his memories safe. 

A book was already sliding off the shelf and opening itself in mid air. Owen closed his eyes and concentrated on what the pages must look like; then he will himself to turn them all to gibberish. The interrogator seemed to stiffen, and tilted his “head” up toward Owen. 

“No,” he whispered.

Without saying a word Owen’s arms and legs were bound again, tighter than before. In a blink Owen freed himself, and, wasting no time, ran toward the Interrogator. He could feel the interrogator attempting to bind him again, but he resisted it. Then, he tripped over a sudden branch that appeared, but landed and bounced on a trampoline he imagined. As he bounced off it and up in to the air the interrogator looked up, and for a brief instant Owen could see two eyes reflected back at him. 

Distracted by the eyes Owen didn’t see the brick wall appear, and he hit it, hard. Pain surged through his left side, and he began to fall, but then he gave himself a soft ledge to land on. As he came to the ledge he twisted his body and in one motion slowed his fall and leapt off in the direction of the interrogator, snakes striking at the air just behind him as he flew off it. In mid air a wall appeared between Owen and the interrogator. Owen was going fast, and there was no way he could avoid the wall, but that was his plan. As he came hurtling toward the wall a knife appeared in his hand, and as the first strands of hair on his head touched the wall, it disappeared. The interrogator was directly in Owen’s path. He lifted his arm and plunged it into the inky black void where the face should be. Instantly the cloak vanished. Ice seemed to flow through Owen’s veins enveloping him in cold, and everything went dark.
