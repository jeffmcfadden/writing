# 13: Wrendale

The rest of the journey to Wrendale was uneventful. The cloaks gave the boys some relief from confrontation; other travelers hardly seemed to notice them as they passed. 

Traffic picked up on the road as they crossed the river, which was running high and wide that day. The bridge was guarded on each end by a set of guards in shimmering metal armor. They nodded slightly to the boys as they crossed; they said nothing. Once over the bridge they passed a few wagons that had pulled aside to rest, and every few minutes or so it seemed they passed another group of travelers making their way up the road and away from the town.

Focused as they were on trying to blend in, the boys could hardly help but gawk as all manner of people passed. There were stout, round Gorloks wearing tough leather armor, tall and thin Benedaci in their colorful, flowing robes, and all manner of elves in their cloaks (which always seemed to be invisible until they were upon you). What the boys _didn’t_ see, we’re any humans. Lexie and the elves had warned them that humans were rare in the Realm in any place, but especially in Wrendale, which was known to cater to some rather fierce anti-human residents. Thankfully no one paid them any attention under their hoods, and they came upon the city without a conflict.

Kayre had explained to the boys that Wrendale was a small outpost of a town, outside the territory of any particular clan, though close to many. As a result it existed in a sort of neutral territory, convenient enough for everyone that it avoided becoming a battle ground, but being outside of any particular territory it was known to be a dangerous place, especially during certain holidays and festivals. Located near the base of the mountains, on the edge of the forest, most of the buildings were small and scattered. Most of the town’s residents at any time were travelers staying in the Inn, and nearly everyone who lived in or near the town worked to cater to those travelers in some way. The inn had been in the family of the Innkeeper and his family (Benedaci) going back seven generations. She had warned them that the tavern was known to be rowdy and dangerous in the evenings, but was usually safe before sundown. The general store was owned by a grumpy old Gorlok named Tol-keth, whose impatience was equaled only by the variety and quality of the goods on the shelves. That was where the boys were headed.

The main strip of the town was cobbled,  with buildings on either side facing the road. They walked around the crowds milling about in the street, passing the inn, the tavern, the stables, the smithy, and a building that looked a lot like a church, but somehow clearly wasn’t one. Finally, at the end of the strip, on the left side, was the general store. The boys pushed the door open and stepped inside.

The first thing Austin noticed were the smells. Hundreds of smells unlike anything he’d ever smelled, coming from every direction. Sweet smells, rich smells, thick smells, and putrescent smells, they were all foreign. It was overwhelming and it took the boys a bit to steady themselves and continue walking through the store.

The rows were narrow and the shelves went to the ceiling, packed in from end to end with all sorts of goods. There were a few things that were recognizable, like boots and saddles, yarn and leather, and cooking utensils. But there were entire sections of the store with goods they had never seen, without any obvious purpose at all.

Joel picked up and was examining a small black box with smooth sides when a loud, gruff voice erupted behind him.

“This store’s for buyin’, not tryin’. Put it back or pay up.”

Joel was so startled by the voice he nearly dropped the box. Turning around to see where the voice was coming from he asked, “But, what is it?”

The voice had been coming from a large, round, leather-armored Gorlok, which Joel now assumed was Tol-keth. 

“What do you mean, ‘what  is it’? It’s a shadow bo —“ Tol-keth made eye contact with Joel and a look of surprise flashed across his face. Luke suspected that he had expected to see an elf under the hood. It probably wasn’t very often that three humans in elf cloaks walked into his shop. 

Tol-keth hissed. “You three get out of here. I don’t need any trouble today. Dol-brek nearly burned my store down the other day when he found out a human had been in here.” He lifted up his arms like he was trying to scare a cat. “C’mon,” he shouted. “Get!”

The boys took a step back and looked at each other. Kayre had told them they might run into a bit of trouble in the store, but she had assured them that Tol-keth was the person they needed to talk to. She told them that if he gave them any trouble in the process they should just tell him that —

“Kayre sent us!” Austin shouted back. “She said you could help us.”

Tol-keth gave Austin a suspicious look. “I don’t know any ‘Kayre’,” he said. “Get out of here.” 

Austin had been prepared for this. “She told us to tell you, ‘the ice is melting, and will soon be thawed.’”

Tol-keth’s face fell and his shoulders slumped. “Kayre,” he muttered. “That elf is going to be the death of me.” After a moment he spun on his heel and started to walk away. “Follow me,” he growled. 

The boys followed him to the register and into a back room. The room was some kind of record keeping room, filled with shelves on three of the walls. A desk filled the length of the other. Tol-keth reached a hand into one of the shelves and adjusted something, and suddenly the entire wall rotated, revealing a passage way behind it. He led them in.

Tol-keth waited for the boys to enter the passage, then did something to shut the entrance behind them. He grabbed a torch from the wall and led them in. The passage was lined with stone, and only a few steps beyond the entrance was a steep and winding staircase. Tol-keth led them down, down, down, into the dark below. His torch was the only light, and the only sound was their shoes slapping the stone steps as they went.

Joel counted at least 150 steps before they reached the bottom. There, Tol-keth stopped abruptly, and the boys nearly ran into him. The stairs ended just before a perfectly smooth stone wall. There were no other exits. The boys looked at each other.

Tol-keth reached into a pocked and pulled out a brass-colored key covered with intricate carvings. He ran his hand over a part of the wall and a small opening appeared. Then, he inserted the key into the opening and stepped back. At first, it seemed as if nothing was happening. Then, slowly, a seam started to appear in the surface of the wall, crawling up the sides and over the top. It continued to grow from side to side until it met in the middle, then it deepened until the shape of a doorway was clear. Finally, a soft _click_, and Tol-keth pulled the key out and put it back into his pocket. He pushed gently on the door and it swung open. He led the boys through.

The room beyond the doorway was large and dimly lit with a few torches. All the walls they could see were covered with shelves of books and other containers, some similar-looking to the _shadow box_ Joel had picked up in the general store, above. On the near side of the room was a large wooden table with eight closely-packed chairs around it. The far side of the room receded into darkness. 

“Sit,” Tol-keth commanded, gesturing to the table. The boys did as they were told. “Remain here. I must return to the store and send message to the others. They will be here as soon as they are able.” And with that, he turned, went out the door, and locked them in.
