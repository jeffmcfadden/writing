# 2: The Three

Luke looked down at the shimmering red dot at the top of the compass. His heart was pounding in his chest. He turned a bit to the left, and the compass swung over to the _N_. The golden needle glittered. The red dot stopped its shimmering. He turned around, and the compass needle flew over to the _S_, though Luke thought it slowed down a bit as it passed over the red dot on its way. He turned back toward the path that forked off the main path. The needle centered firmly atop the dot, and the shimmering started again.

Owen let out a shout. “We did it! We found the Realm!” He gestured to Joel. “Quick, get out the map.”

Joel took off his backpack and removed a thin bronze tube. He twisted the end, opened it, and pulled out a rolled piece of parchment. He unrolled it and held it open in front of him. The other boys gathered round to look.

At first glance it looked like a fairly regular map. The upper right corner was filled with a fancy cursive writing of the words _The Realm_. Next to that was a sort of compass rose, but instead of a circle it was a pentagon, and the lines emanating from it weren’t straight, but curvy, almost dancing across the surface of the map. The map showed a large area of land, with mountains and valleys, streams, rivers, and lakes. Running among all these features were myriad paths and roads. Along the outer edge of the map were a series of small red dots, each the same color as the red of the dot on Luke’s compass. Various roads seemed to make their way to the dots, but go no further. They all just seemed to stop, right at the border.

As Joel scanned the map intently, the other boys couldn’t help but be distracted by everything that was going on on the parchment. This was no ordinary map. It was _alive_ with activity. The tiny trees were swaying in the wind. Small waves rolled across the surface of the lakes. Here and there a bird soared over a valley, while shadows darted in and out of the trees, and small shapes scampered across the grasses, themselves bending and shimmering in the wind. Luke reached out to touch one of the lakes, and when he pulled his finger back, a drop of water fell from it. 

“Here!” Joel exclaimed. He pointed to one of the red dots at the bottom right of the map. Everyone leaned in a bit to look at it. Unlike the other red dots, this one had a small bit of road that extended beyond the dot, right to the edge of the parchment. And there, right beyond the dot, on the road, were four tiny figures.

“That’s us!” exclaimed Austin. He turned and waved at the sky. Luke couldn’t be sure, but thought maybe he saw one of the four figures on the map moving a bit.

Owen cleared his throat and addressed the other boys. “Gentlemen,” he said, “this confirms it. We have arrived at the border of the Realm, the magical world just beyond our own. The world we have been searching for all this time. Somewhere inside are the answers to our questions, the end of our quest. All we have to do to finish our mission is _stick together_.” He looked at the boys seriously. “Everyone ready?”

Joel and Austin nodded enthusiastically. Luke looked at the ground for a while and considered the situation. He wasn’t sure this would be a safe journey. The whole idea of a magical realm was new to him, and he was still having trouble believing it. Still, these were his friends, and he trusted them. He looked up at Owen and nodded. 

“Good,” said Owen. Let’s go.

Joel packed up the map, they all got their backpacks back on, and Owen led them down the fork in the road. 

At first there wasn’t much about this new path that was different from the main one. It was about as wide as the main path it branched from, with the same sort of trees and undergrowth, the same sort of birds calling to one another in the tree tops, the same lizards scampering away from the boys into the brush.

It wasn’t too long, however, and Luke started to notice some differences. For instance, the trees were familiar, but not _exactly right_. The tall Pines were the right size _around_, but seemed to be a good bit _taller_ than the ones he was used to. Their needles seemed just a bit sharper than you would expect, and their cones fell constantly out of the trees, always almost landing on your head, like they were trying to hit you. Luke was pretty sure he saw a lizard with fangs, but it disappeared so quickly he couldn’t be sure.

They trudged along for the better part of an hour as the path meandered through the woods, dodging pine cones falling from the trees. Luke noticed that it didn’t seem to be getting any darker. The sky still had a sort of golden hue of twilight, but the sun was hidden behind the tall trees around them. 

Owen and Austin were at the front of the line now, bickering again, as they had been for the better part of an hour. Luke was too far back to hear exactly what they were arguing about, but it seemed to be related to where they were headed. Owen seemed to have one destination in mind, and Austin another. 

“I’m the leader, Aust. You just need to get used to it.”

“No way, Owen,” Austin replied. “We shouldn’t go there first, we should go to the Lake. That’s what the book said.”

“You just want to go swimming,” replied Owen.

“I do not! I want to find the treasure as much as you. But the book said, ‘The gold glitters upon the shores of Lake Aurum.’ That has to be where it is.”

“Nope. It’s not there. No way. It has to be in the center of the Black Forest. Just like the book said, ‘Deep in the center of the dark will you find the wealth your heart desires.’ It’s in the forest.”

Austin grumbled loudly, balling his hands into fists. He trudged back into the line again, muttering about how they should be going to the lake, not to the center of a deadly forest. 

They walked in silence for a while, then came around a sharp right bend. As they turned, they could see there was something in the middle of the road, but it was in the shadows, and the sun’s angle made it hard to tell what. By the time they found out, it was too late.

There, in the middle of the road, coiled tightly, was a massive rattlesnake. It’s rattle was shaking violently back and forth. The noise was so loud that Luke, who was at the back of the line, covered his ears. Owen, at the front, stopped dead, and held up his hands as if to say, “whoa whoa.” But the snake paid no mind. Luke watched in horror, and time seemed to slow down. The snake reared up and lunged at Owen, its mouth open, fangs at the ready, already dripping with venom. Owen turned away from the snake, but not fast enough. Then, just when the fangs were ready to sink into Owen’s back, Luke heard a distinct _tick_. The snake stopped dead in the air, frozen in place. Luke looked around. It wasn’t just the snake. The trees had frozen too, mid-sway. The shadows no longer danced, and the birds in the sky were motionless, mid-flap. Complete silence surrounded them. Luke’s ears were ringing.

“Come on!” Shouted Austin. “We have 10 seconds! Run!”

Luke, still confused about what was going on, didn’t wait to ask, and ran down the path as Austin ordered. Joel grabbed Owen, moved him away from the snake, and they ran ahead without looking back.

Ten seconds later Luke heard what he thought sounded like another _tick_, and the world moved back to full speed. The trees swayed in the breeze, and the birds flew overhead, calling to one another as they always did.

They ran full-out for at least another minute before they stopped, lungs and legs burning from their sprint. “What just happened!?” Luke cried.

“_That_,” answered Joel, “was the Copper Pocket Watch, Austin’s artifact. It can manipulate time. Slow it down, stop it, and in some cases, even reverse it.”

“Whoa,” said Luke.

“But,” Austin chimed in, “the effect doesn’t last forever. And it takes time to recharge.” He held out his hand to Luke, and in it was a small copper-colored pocket watch. On the dial was a small rectangle. It currently had a red line running through it at an angle. “As it charges up the rectangle turns from red to yellow to green. When it’s full it will stop time for up to a whole minute. It lasts longer if you just slow time down a bit, instead of stopping it all the way.”

“Whoa,” said Luke, still catching his breath. “You know, that was a big snake.”

“Huge,” said Joel. “A Great Southern Thunder Rattle, if I’m not mistaken. One drop of that venom could melt your arm clean off. They like to wait in the middle of paths, in the shadows. That was a close one.”

“You’re telling me,” said Owen, rubbing the back of his neck. “Of course, if Austin had been _doing his job_, we’d have known about it long before we nearly got killed by it.”

“What!?” Cried Austin, incredulously. “This wasn’t my fault! I didn’t put a thunder rattle in the middle of the road!”

“It’s your job to keep a look out, especially if you’re #2 in the line,” replied Owen.

Austin was turning red, and breathing hard. “Owen! That is not fair! No one can sense a Thunder Rattle, they’re practically cloaked! And if you would have gone to the Lake, we wouldn’t even have been on this path in the first place!”

“WE ARE NOT GOING TO THE LAKE!” Yelled Owen.

“WE SHOULD BE!” Yelled Austin.

“I’M THE LEADER OF THIS PARTY!” Screamed Owen. “YOU NEED TO FOLLOW ME, OR GO HOME.”

Austin stared at Owen, his face crimson with anger. Owen stared back. Luke and Joel could only watch. After what seemed like an eternity, Austin turned around, faced the wall of trees along the path, and simply walked into the forest.

“No!” Shouted Joel. “Austin, we need you!” 

Austin didn’t turn back. He just kept walking.

“No! No! No!” Cried Joel. “This can’t be happening! We’ll never find the treasure without all the artifacts!” He shouted at the trees, “Austin!  Austin, come back!”

But there was no answer. The Four had become the Three.
