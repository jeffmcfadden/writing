# 14: A Lesson

The boys sat in silence as the sound of Tol-keth’s footsteps faded away. It wasn’t long before Austin got up.

“No way am I just sitting here.” He started scanning the shelves, reading the titles on the spines. Most were written in some kind of runes that he couldn’t understand. “What _is_ all this stuff?” He wondered aloud.

Luke and Joel looked at each other. Luke shrugged and stood up, headed toward another wall. The shelves here were also covered in books and other items, most with indecipherable runes covering them. He grabbed a random book off the shelf.

The cover was black and seemed to be made out of a soft leather. Down the spine were a few runes, pressed into the surface, all a glittering gold. They were so _bright_ it was mesmerizing. Luke took the book over to the table and sat down, opening it up. Just like his mom’s old books at home, this one had the smell of age in it. That thick, dusty scent reminded Luke of home, tightening a knot in his stomach. He pushed thoughts of home aside and turned slowly through the book. The deep black ink seemed to sit above the paper, but he couldn’t feel anything as he rubbed the surface with his finger.

Flipping farther into the book he found a few pages of diagrams. The first few were just runes and arrows that he couldn’t read, but a few pages to the right and he stopped cold.

“Guys, check this out!” Luke shouted.

Joel and Austin hurriedly shoved their books back into the shelves and ran over to the table. There, taking up the whole page, was a diagram with four objects on it: a compass, a map, a pocket watch, and an umbrella. 

“The artifacts,” said Joel. 

“What does it mean?” Asked Austin. “What does it say?”

“I don’t know,” Luke answered. “I can’t read these runes.” 

He turned the next few pages, but there were no other diagrams, just more symbols from top to bottom. He was just flipping back to the diagram when they all heard footsteps from outside the door.

The boys scurried, returning their books to the shelves and re-taking their places at the table. The lock had just made its _click_ when Joel slid into his chair. 

The door opened and two hooded figured entered. One was very tall, having to stoop its head to get through the doorway. The other was much shorter, and seemed much rounder beneath the cloak. They entered and walked to the end of the table, where they removed their hoods. 

Revealed on the right was a beautiful Benedaci woman. She had a long, slender face with well defined features and bright green eyes. Her typical Benedacian robes were covered by the cloak she was wearing but the boys could still make out a beautiful crimson scarf around her neck. 

On the left was a squat Gorlock. He had deep-set dark eyes that looked strong and dangerous, yet kind, set into a very round face with large nose and a protruding chin. 

The Benedaci smiled and spoke first.

“Welcome, Protectors! What an honor it is for us to finally meet you. I am Dryndahar, and this is Ryuk-pal. We represent the Council here in Wrendale. A safe house is being prepared for you as we speak. We should be able to leave Wrendale this evening, and the Council will be assembled tomorrow evening to speak with you, as I am sure you are eager to —“ 

Dryndahar stopped suddenly and looked at the table again.

“Where is the fourth?” She asked.

The boys looked at each other. Austin spoke. 

“We don’t know. He disappeared through a door in the air and —“

Ryuk-pal interrupted. “A door in the air? That’s impossible.”

“Yeah, we’ve heard that a lot lately. But yeah, anyway he disappeared through a door in the air and we don’t really know where he is now. We were kinda hoping maybe you guys could help with that. Also, what is this ‘Council’, and why would we want to meet with them? And, could you maybe help us understand what all this ‘Protectors’ stuff is about?”

Ryuk-pal and Dryndahar paused and looked at each other, their faces falling.

“Are you not aware of your role here, Protectors?” Dryndahar asked.

“We’ve only been in the Realm a few days,” Luke said. “We aren’t really aware of much, to be honest.” He looked up at the shelves. “We were kind of hoping some of these books might be helpful, but they’re all written in runes we don’t understand.”

“Fate does not seem to be on our side,” Dryndahar muttered. She shook her head. “Namach’s advantage is much greater than we feared, if these are our Protectors.” 

Ryuk-pal gestured to Dryndahar, and they sat down at the table with the boys. He looked at each of them with concern.

“Tell us about your friend and the, ‘door in the air,’” He said.

The boys re-told the story of Owen being captured, including the strange doorway opening up in the air, and Owen being grabbed through it. Ryuk-pal and Dryndahar paid close attention to every detail, asking many questions throughout the story. When it was over they all sat in silence for a long while.

Ryuk-pal sighed. “Indeed, it is even worse than we had feared,” he said. “The rumors are true. Namach has mastered the Portaling, and is willing and able to use it to suit his own purposes, even to capture a Protector. The Council is not prepared for this.” 

“Who is this _Council_ you keep talking about?” Joel asked.

“The Council are the stewards of the Realm. We are members of many tribes who desire peace, not the conflict of our ancestors. We have sought to work together to oppose Namach’s march to power, but there are not many outside us who even believe he is real, let alone that he has amassed such power as he is rumored to have at his disposal. We have long sought the Protectors —“ he made a gesture by spreading his arms — “ you. Though, I have to say you are not what we anticipated.” He stared at the table.

Dryndahar jumped in. “Your friend, ‘Owen’. Where is he now?”

Austin flushed. “We told you. We have no idea.”

“Have you not the map?” Dryndahar asked, patiently.

“Of course we have the map.” He gestured at Joel. “But what good will that do? We don’t know where Owen is, so how will we find him, even with a map?”

Dryndahar gestured to Joel. “It seems that perhaps you do not yet know the full power of the Protectors. Reveal the map, please.”

Joel opened his bag and removed the bronze tube. He opened it, removed the map, laid it out on the table in front of him, and looked up at Dryndahar.

Dryndahar smiled and stood up, then walked over to the nearest wall. She scanned the shelves. 

“Hm,” she muttered. “Let’s see. I know it’s here.” She scanned some more. “Aha!” 

She reached out and pulled the same book Luke had been looking at earlier. She brought it over and laid it on the table in front of her. She thumbed through the book, stopping a few pages after the diagram the boys had found with the four artifacts drawn out.

“This book is a history of the Artifacts, and contains all that is known about where they came from and how they work. Here. Let me translate.”

_It is unknown when the Map was created, as it is unknown who it was that created it. It has existed long before the first Protectors, though it belongs to them only now, so far as we know._

_The Map can be made to show many things, and may choose to show others of its own will. The Protector may choose at any time what the map should display, including the position of the other Protectors within the Realm. By manipulating the legend, the map will change._

“So,” she said. “You see.”

“Except, _how_ does that work?” Joel asked.

“Try it,” she said.

Joel held his hand out to the map, and placed it over the legend, in the lower right corner. Currently it only displayed major towns and rivers, that sort of thing. He lifted his hand up and down, but nothing happened. So he poked at it a bit, and slid his fingers over it. Still, nothing. He pounded his fist on the table. 

“This doesn’t work,” he seethed.

“Try it again,” Ryuk-pal encouraged. “This time, with patience, and focus.”

Joel took a deep breath and closed he eyes, he placed his hand over the map and slowly moved it back and forth. As he did, he thought he felt a small protrusion on the surface, like the edge of a dial. He slowly ran his fingers along it, and it felt as thought it rotated under them. He opened his eyes and looked at the map. There, in the spot marking Wrendale, were three small red dots. And there, in the far upper corner, atop a huge mountain, was a fourth.

They had found Owen, and he was in danger.
