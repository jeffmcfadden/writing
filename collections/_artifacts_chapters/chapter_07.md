# 7: Bindings

Owen reached out for the book. “Let me see that,” he said excitedly. He opened it and thumbed through, nodding as he went. He seemed impressed. He furrowed his brow and thumbed through some more of the book. He seemed to get too far in, and flipped back a few pages before stopping. “Aha!” He exclaimed. “Listen to this, guys.” He started reading.

> Day 13: I’ve been here nearly two weeks, but I haven’t found any evidence that The Four have been here yet. It’s possible that I’ve just missed them, but I don’t think so. None of the signs have been seen, and I’ve talked to everyone I can think of. 

“What!? ‘The Four’?”, Joel cried. “Does that mean us? How could someone else know about us?”

“Shh,” Owen said. “Keep listening.” He read on.

> The Thurogants have seen nothing from the Outside anywhere in the North, and they have eyes everywhere. The Oktilians assure me that if anything had wandered into their forests they would know about it, most likely because they would have found the bones; they are confident that The Four have not yet arrived. The elves...

“Elves!?” Cried Luke. “There are elves here?”

Austin looked at Luke incredulously. “Of course there are elves here. Owen, keep reading.”

> The elves still refuse to speak to me, except for Hurim, who still trusts me. He assures me that The Four have not been found by the elves, but it may be dangerous for them if they are. My hope is that they come by the South roads, through the Sparse Forests. They have the best chance of arriving undiscovered if they make it that way. I plan to head that direction soon if I am able.

“Hm, that is the direction we came,” noted Owen. “Seems like The Compass knows what it’s doing.” He turned the page.

> The atmosphere is getting tense again. The Madroc tribes seem to be organizing rather than fighting, which has everyone a bit on edge. Something is going on up there, but no one seems to know quite what it is. There are whispers of a new power. In my darker moments I’ve wondered if that could mean... but no, that can’t be. There was already rumor of some of the tribes attempting to broker a peace among themselves, saying that the fighting was draining them of all of their resources. There must be a new chief up there; even a tenuous cease fire would be a victory for those savages. 

“Sounds like a war is going on somewhere, or as been,” Luke said. “And what’s that sentence that he didn’t finish? What’s he talking about.”

“I’m not sure,” said Owen. “But that’s not the end of it. There’s a page missing, and then there’s this:”

> Something is following me. I haven’t yet spotted it in the open, but I’m sure that it’s there. I’ve managed to make my way down to the old Grathorian ruins, near the edge of the Sparse Forest. The magic is still deeper here, and the Mirror seems to be much stronger. I still haven’t found The Four, but I have reason to suspect that they are getting near. I saw... things... in the mirror today that lead me to believe that the fourth artifact has been recovered. If so, it’s only a matter of time before they arrive. I have begun the preparations. By tomorrow I should be finished with...

“Finished with what?” Joel asked.

“That’s it, it just stops there,” Owen answered. “The sentence isn’t finished. It’s like they where interrupted or something.”

“But, who _are_ they?” Luke asked. “This person seems to know who we are. Who is he?”

“I have no idea,” Owen said. “I didn’t really think we’d actually find _anyone_ here. The Atlas mentioned lots of magical creatures, but all the civilizations it spoke about... I thought they were extinct, or old tales.”

“What happened to him?” Austin asked. “The writer, I mean. It seems like he was trying to find us, was hot on our trail, then something was following him, and then he just, _disappears_? And why didn’t he take his book with him? It seems like a fairly important book.”

“I dunno,” Owen said, “but it makes me nervous. Someone must know we’re here by now. We need to be more careful. From now on we walk together, in silence. We take watches at night. And we’ll use the umbrella in shifts.”

“But where do we go from here?” Luke asked.

Owen and Austin looked at each other and laughed together, nervously. Then Owen spoke first. “I want to go to the forest, Austin wants to go to the lake. But it sounds like we need to change our plans and find the owner of this book. He wrote about coming from the north. I think we should head back that way and see if we can find him, or some of these people. Maybe they could tell us where he is. What do you guys think?”

“I agree. We need to know who knows that we’re here, and why they care,” Austin said.

“I agree, too,” said Luke.

“Me too,” said Joel.

“Then it’s settled,” said Owen. “Let’s get our stuff and get out of here.” 

He took the book and put it away in his backpack, zipped it up, and put it on. The other boys did the same. When they were all standing again Owen motioned with his arm and they started for the door. As they did, there was a loud _crack_ right outside the door. Instinctually they all knelt down in the dirt, craning their necks to see outside. 

Owen turned back and mouthed silently to the rest of the boys: _There’s someone here._
