# 12: The Fire

With full stomachs and a night of restful sleep, the three boys walked together on the path to Wrendale. They were clothed in new cloaks, given to them by the elves. Each cloak fit its owner perfectly, keeping them cool in the warm sun of the late morning. They walked briskly down the path; they had business to attend to in Wrendale, and there would be no time to smell the flowers as they went.

They had stayed with the elves and Lexie the previous night, enjoying the warmth and safety of an Elvish campfire in a small clearing in a nearby stand of birch trees. There they retold the story of Owen’s abduction by the invisible creature, how he disappeared into what seemed to be a doorway torn out of the very air itself. Whenever they mentioned the doorway the elves scrunched up their faces, but they refused to answer any questions about it. It was Lexie who finally explained to them that _portaling_, as it was called, was an old and dangerous magic, unused by even the most seasoned wizards because of the damage that it could do. That anyone was willing to _try_ it, let alone _master_ it, was cause for great concern. After conversing amongst themselves the elves had determined to travel directly to ELFTOWNHERE in the morning to report this news to the Council. It was likely that plans for battle, which had been in progress for some time now, would need to be accelerated. 

“But what does all this mean for Owen?” Joel asked. “Is he ok? How do we get him back?”

The elves look at one another in a long silence. Finally, Kayre spoke. “Your friend, wherever he is, is in grave danger. Magic of this kind has not been used since the days of the Protectors, and no one who could harness it can be trusted. To gain mastery over the portal requires a giving up of one’s self to the magic, letting the magic take over a part of you. Magic itself has only one goal: to grow itself to be more powerful. It does not care what it takes to accomplish that end; it would destroy the universe in an instant if it could find the right conduits, which is why the harnessing of magic for good is such a difficult and rare gift. It is possible that your friend is alive, but I would not count on it.”

There was a long silence around the fire as the weight of Kayre’s comments sunk in. 

“Who could do it, though?” Luke asked.

“Who could do what?” Responded Kayre.

“Who could master the portal? If it’s so rare, so difficult, there must not be very many people who could do it. If we knew who might have done it, we could track them down and find Owen.”

The elves sat again in silence, looking at one another. Luke thought that it seemed that they were somehow talking amongst themselves in these moments, though no one could hear anything being said.

Kayre turned after a while and spoke. “There are stories of a dark elf, rejected by his people, who left his home and fled to the dark woods of Angstorm, where he discovered a long-hidden magic. Seduced by the promise of power, this dark elf gave himself over to the magic, piece by piece, until it transformed him into an altogether different kind of creature. With power beyond that of any other mortal being, he retreated to the top of Gray Mountain, where it is said he  constructed a fortification, and has been gathering his own dark armies, promising them victory over their foes if they will pledge allegiance to him. While no one has actually seen him, there have been many reports of strange fires atop the mountain on dark nights.”

“Who is this creature?” Austin demanded. “What is his name?”

Again, silence as the elves looked at one another. This time, though, after their inaudible conversation they all turned their eyes down, not looking at Austin.

“Tell me!” He shouted. “Who has my brother?”

Silence.

“TELL ME!”

Kayre sighed, and looked up at Austin. “He has been called many names by many peoples. _Horthnok_ by the Gorloks, _Rikt’olsh_ by the Benedaci, and _Ungolrath_ by the Old Elves.  But, there is a name that all know, which is what he calls himself. _Namach_. The other elves shuddered as Kayre spoke it, and even the boys felt the darkness grow around them as the words echoed in the trees. They sat in silence, looking at the fire as it crackled under a clear sky.

Joel stood up. “Then that’s it. That’s where we’re going,” he said. 

“Where?” Luke asked.

“To Angstorm. We’re going to Angstorm and we’re going to take Owen back from Namach.”

Kayre laughed, a scary, high pitched cackle. “You cannot walk into Angstorm. You cannot just take your friend back. Namach is no troll. He is the greatest wizard alive. He has taken mastery of portaling. What other evil magic he knows, who can say? No, he will not be defeated by 3 little boys.”

Luke stood up now, next to Joel. “We aren’t some ‘little boys’. We have something he doesn’t know about, and could never expect.” 

“And what is that?” Asked Kayre.

Austin stood up now, with the others. They all looked at one another, and spoke in unison.

“The artifacts.”
