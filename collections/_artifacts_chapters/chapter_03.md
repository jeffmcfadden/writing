# 3: Ursa Major

Owen, Luke, and Joel trudged ahead in silence for a while. They didn’t come upon any more giant snakes, but there did seem to be more strange creatures than before. There were some crimson squirrels, bright purple jays, and all manner of creepy crawlies, often with large fangs. 

The sun still hadn’t set, but it did seem to be getting a bit darker, and there were a few clouds in the distance. Everything was gloomy.

Owen dodged a pine cone and spoke first. “I really shouldn’t have lost my temper with Austin. We’ll need all four of us to succeed. I still don’t think we should be going to the lake, but I could have been a lot nicer to Austin.” He stopped suddenly. “Ugh! This is all my fault!”

“There’s nothing we can do now,” Joel said. “We’ll just have to stay on the path and hope that we don’t need Austin with the stopwatch for a while.”

“Can’t we just look for him on the map?” Asked Luke.

“No can do,” Joel said. “Once the stopwatch is used, it makes the owner invisible to the map for a few hours, sometimes longer. There’s no way he’ll be on there now, and anyway unless he’s out in the open we’d never see him within the trees anyway.”

“Oh, right,” Luke replied. 

They continued on in silence for a while, not really sure where they were going. The path they were on hadn’t had any forks yet, so it seemed as good a path as any. It had taken them through the forest, then turned and started to climb. The forest on the right of them started to slope away fairly steeply, though they couldn’t see past the trees to tell where they were headed.

After a while Luke spoke up, “How did you guys learn about the Realm, anyway?”

“Owen’s Uncle Joe,” Joel answered. “For Owen’s last birthday Joe gave him an almanac. _The Abridged Almanac of Magical Things and Places_. It has information about everything. The Realm, the artifacts, the treasure, the creatures. Joe said he had been waiting for Owen to turn 10 so he could give it to him. Then, once Owen had it, he had to keep it a secret. Joe was the first one to find a way into The Realm. Joe also gave Owen the Umbrella, which helped us find the next artifact...”

“The Umbrella?” Luke interrupted.

“Yeah, the Umbrella is the first artifact we found. Once it’s opened it lets the owner...”

Owen stopped dead. “Shhh!” He pointed ahead, at the edge of the path. There in the shadow, was some kind of creature, about as big as a huge dog. Luke couldn’t be sure, but it seemed to be growling. Owen slowly set his bag down and started to reach into it when the created charged at them. 

“Run!” someone shouted.

The boys scattered, and as the creature emerged from the shadows they could see that it was a massive hog. It was covered in quills, like a porcupine, with large tusks protruding from each side of its massive jaws. It ran straight for Owen’s bag. With one smooth motion it picked it up with it’s tusks and tossed it high into the air. Then it made a hard left turn and charged straight at Luke. 

Luke was already a few paces ahead of the hog, but as he turned to look back he tripped over a root and fell hard onto the ground, skinning his knees and throwing dust into his eyes. He tried to look up to see where the hog was, but he couldn’t get his eyes to open properly. The thundering hooves were racing toward him, so he did the only thing he could think of and leapt far to his right, toward what he thought was the brush.

Instead of landing among the leaves, he fell a lot farther than he expected, getting slapped in the face by a barrage of branches before he landed hard on his side. He was on a steep embankment, and his momentum kept him rolling and tumbling down the side, through every bush and over every rock on the way. When he finally rolled to a stop at the bottom a pine tree threw a cone and hit him in the back of the head.

“Ow!”

Luke sat in silence, trying to blink to get his eyes to open. After a few moments he was able to open his eyes and get his bearings. He was at the bottom of a large, tree covered embankment. Somehow he had rolled down the entire thing without smacking into a tree, and ended up in a small clearing. The trees seemed to be less dense down here; he could see a few hundred feet in every direction.

It was utterly silent down here. He couldn’t hear anything from the path above. A knot formed in his stomach, and he was very afraid for his friends. He knew they had run when the hog had appeared, and the hog had chased _him_, but he couldn’t be sure they had gotten away safely. He also remembered Owen’s bag flying high into the air. He wasn’t sure how they’d get anywhere without all the supplies in there.

Luke stood up. By some miracle he still had his own backpack on. 

“I bet that’s how I didn’t hit too many rocks on the way down,” he said, to no one in particular.

He looked up at the embankment. It was much too steep to attempt to climb back up, and besides, there was a giant quill-covered hog up there. Better to try to keep going in the direction they were going before, and see if he could find another path.

He started walking in the direction he thought they had been going, then he stopped, furrowing his brow. He reached into his pocked and pulled out a silver compass, and opened it. Inside, the dot at the top was slowly pulsing. He turned to his right just a bit, and the gold needle swung round to point at it. He looked around in the other directions, shrugged, and started walking toward the dot. 

As he walked he checked the compass every so often. As he did so he noticed that the direction of the dot seemed to wander a bit. It didn’t really go in a straight line. 

He followed the dot for a long time. Up hills, down hills, through the trees, across meadows. He even crossed a few small streams. Often he was so engrossed in watching the compass he accidentally walked right into a tree branch or a cobweb. A few of those cobwebs had giant blue spiders in them. 

After scraping off one of those cobwebs he followed the compass left around a large outcropping of gray rock. The dot kept him close, making a sharp turn. On the other side of the outcropping the ground sloped away sharply toward another meadow. Luke followed the dot down the hill to the meadow, and was so engrossed in the compass that he nearly ran right into the giant bear that was standing there.

It was brown, standing on its hind legs, and at least 10 feet tall. It’s legs were so long Luke was pretty sure that he could run right between them. The claws on each paw must have been at least 9 inches long, and sharp as razors. Next to the bear were three smaller bears. Luke figured they must have been its cubs. But these cubs were huge, 6 feet tall at least, with the same razor claws as their mother. 

The bear roared at Luke, with a roar louder than any he had ever imagined. He started to back up, to try to go back the way he came, but he stumbled onto the grass. 

The bear took the opportunity to leap toward Luke, covering the distance across the meadow in an instant. As it raised it’s arm to strike Luke, he closed his eyes and covered his head, bracing for the impact. But instead of feeling the fatal crash of the bear’s claws, he heard a _tick_, and felt someone grabbing him by his backpack and dragging him away.

“Get up!” He heard a familiar voice shout. “We have to go!”

Luke turned and saw Austin, running as fast as he could into the woods, out of the meadow. Luke ran faster than he ever had, not even looking back to see the bears, frozen in time. Part of him wondered what the bear would think when time continued and all that was in front of it was empty space. He smirked.

They ran so fast their legs burned, and when they heard the _tick_ of time going back to normal they didn’t change their pace. They ran until they couldn’t breathe, their legs like Jelly. They fell into the brush and laid on their backs, gasping for breath, listening for any giant bears that might be in pursuit. There weren’t any.

Austin looked over at Luke. “Well, that was a close one.”
