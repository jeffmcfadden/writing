# 11:  Uncloaking

Joel’s heart was pounding in his ears. The world seemed to be getting dark around the edges. He was on his knees, hands held high. Ahead of him, standing on the front of a covered wagon with a scarlet roof was a cloaked figure holding a crossbow, pointed directly at his heart. The sun was high, glaring into Joel’s eyes, keeping the face of the owner of the cloak in shadow. His attempt to find help had gone horribly wrong; rather than offer food or water, the stranger in front of him had become a deadly peril. He was out of ideas, so he continued to beg for help.

“Wait! Please! Listen!” He yelled. “We’re just travelers. We have no water, no food. Our friend was kidnapped, taken from us, through air.” He thought he might have seen the crossbow waver, just a bit, when he mentioned the curtain in the air. But it returned to its place, directed at his heart. “We don’t know where he could be. We don’t know who took him. We are going to Wrendale to look for help.” 

Still the cloaked figure stood motionless, finger on the trigger of the crossbow. Joel heard a commotion behind him and turned to look. He saw Austin and Luke, with hoods over their heads, surrounded by other cloaked figures. They were done for. 

Suddenly all Joel wanted in the world was to just go home. To sleep in his own bed, to play again, with his own toys. He was sorry he had ever come to the Realm, sorry for all the wretched things that had happened here. As he thought of home his heart swelled, and his eyes filled with tears.

“We shouldn’t even be here!” He screamed, to no one in particular. “If it weren’t for those stupid artifacts we’d still be at home, enjoying a nice din—“

“Did you say, ‘Artifacts’?” 

Joel snapped his head up toward the cloaked figure. He wasn’t _positive_ that’s where the question came from, but he couldn’t see anyone else around, so he spoke in that direction.

“Yea. Artifacts. Four of them. A map, a compass, an umbrella —“

“There are three of you. Where is the fourth?” It was definitely the cloaked figure talking.

“I told you already,” Joel said. “Our friend was kidnapped, snatched right out from in front of us through a curtain in the air, by some weird air-creature or something.” 

At that the figured lowered the cross bow and leapt gracefully from the wagon onto the ground in front of Joel. It walked right up to him, and pull down its hood.

Long, blonde hair flowed out from under the hood and revealed a beautiful girl beneath. With slender features and fierce green eyes she carried herself in the sort of way that a warrior does, and Joel knew at once that she was not one to be trifled with. 

She took another step toward Joel and bowed deeply, extending her hand. As she did Joel noticed the small point at the tip of her ear. “I am Kayre,” she said, “and it is my great pleasure to meet one of the five.” 

Joel sat, stunned. Wondering if he had falling into a dream, he took the extended hand, and Kayre helped him to his feet. She gestured to the other cloaked figures, and they released Luke and Austin, who ran to Joel.

“Joel! What is going on?” Austin shouted.

“Um,” Joel stammered. “Well, this is—“

“I am Kayre. It is a great pleasure to meet one—well, three—of the five.” She bowed deeply to Austin, then to Luke.

“You keep saying that,” Joel said. “_The Five._ But there are only four of us. What do you mean, _Five_?”

Luke answered before Kayre had a chance. “Don’t you remember, Joel. It was written in the top of the table. _When the four come together_—“

But it was a different voice altogether that finished the sentence. Coming from inside the wagon, “_the fifth will be revealed._” And as the sentence was finished, it’s speaker appeared at the front of the wagon. Another cloaked figure. The boys watched as it jumped down in front of them and pulled off its hood. Long blonde hair fell out from the hood, revealing blazing blue eyes and a face that they all recognized at once.

“Lexie?” Said Austin, in disbelief. “Is it really you?”

Lexie beamed, and ran and hugged Austin, then Luke, then Joel. She stood back and looked them over. “Of course it’s me, silly! What did you expect? Trolls?”

Luke tried to laugh, but he was as confused as ever. “Lexie, how in the world are you here, in the Realm? And how are you traveling with Elves? And how do you know about the artifacts? And... what is going on!?”

Lexie laughed, a loud and hearty laugh. “Don’t worry, Luke,” she said, “all your questions will be answered in time.” She gestured to the still-cloaked figures. “Lindy, Saesha, let’s get our guests some food and water. They seem to have come rather unprepared.”

Lindy and Saesha let down their hoods, revealing two more elves with the same slender features as Kayre. Lindy had dark hair, nearly black, and Saesha had auburn hair, with golden flecks that caught the light, shimmering and dancing in the sun. Together they nodded to Lexie, then climbed silently and effortlessly up the wagon and into the back, coming out moments later with their arms full of baskets and jugs. 

Lindy opened one basket and removed a cloth, tossing it into the air with a flick of her wrist. It unfolded into a large square and then it just _stayed_ there, floating in midair. She flicked another cloth and it unfolded as well, covering the shaded ground beneath the first.

Lexie gestured to the cloth on the ground. “Sit. Let’s have lunch.”

Luke wasn’t sure he’d ever tasted anything as good as the lunch they had that day. Sandwiches and fruit and biscuits and all kinds of sweets. And water. Glorious, fresh, clear, _cold_ water. Luke thought he must have drank a gallon.

Lexie spoke as they ate. 

“I can’t answer _all_ your questions, but I’ll answer what I can. The Realm is known to many; though humans are rare here, we aren’t the first, nor will we be the last. There are many good and wonderful beings here, seeking the good of those around them. And there are just as many, or perhaps more, evil ones, set on destroying all that is good here that they might have greater power. That evil is currently growing; the Realm is more dangerous now than it has been in many lifetimes.

“Long ago there were four artifacts, forged by those who sought to protect the Realm. They were used to quell an ancient evil, and for a time peace reigned. But that ancient evil gathered itself up again, and rose against the Protectors. The battle was fierce, and the Protectors used the artifacts to save the Realm once more. But in the final battle the artifacts were scattered, sent outside of the realm, to be discovered by those who could help if the realm was in danger once again. And now it is.

“It was the artifacts themselves that led you here. To many in the Realm you are known as the Keepers, or the Five. You (and the artifacts) are legends, told from generation to generation. You are also in grave danger now. Owen will not be the last Keeper they try to take. You were wise to head to Wrendale. It is still mostly safe. But it may not be for long.”

“But what is the fifth?” Luke asked. “And when will it be revealed?”

“That is a mystery I have not yet unlocked,” Lexie replied. “Though not for lack of trying. I have searched every ancient text I can find, talked to every elder who will speak, and none knows for sure what the Fifth really is.”

They all sat in silence for a while, considering what Lexie had told them. It was a lot to take in. Good and Evil, unknown enemies that were out to get them, ancient magic at work. It was overwhelming. Austin broke the silence by asking what they were all thinking.

“Well, what do we do now?”
