# 8: A Curtain

Luke’s heart was racing. He could feel it pounding in his chest, and the coppery taste of adrenaline filled his mouth. At first it seemed impossible, but there was no mistaking it: Owen was right, _someone was here._ They could hear the _crunch_ of the footsteps as they moved in and around the buildings. They seemed to be getting closer.

Owen frantically motioned for everyone to move close to him as he pulled a leather pouch out of his back pack. He unfastened the clasp at the end and pulled out a large umbrella. Slowly and silently he slid the mechanism up the main shaft and the umbrella opened. 

Austin reached back and grabbed Luke’s shoulder, pulling him closer to Owen. As he stepped closer, and under the umbrella, he noticed that the world around him seemed to dim slightly. He looked down at his feet. _They_ looked the same, but the ground just outside the coverage of the umbrella had that dim, washed out look to it. Luke stuck his arm out and watched as it turned dimmer, and grayer, as it passed out from under the umbrella. And that’s when he understood: _The umbrella was cloaking them all._ The outside world looked dim to them, but to everyone on the outside, they looked like, well, nothing. They were invisible.

Owen motioned them all forward, and together they took one step at a time, in unison. Luke held his breath as he lifted his own foot, afraid that the unseen person would hear some noise in his movement. 

They took two more steps forward, and their method seemed to be working. Their steps kept them together under the umbrella, and they were able to move without making a sound. 

They moved out through the doorway (avoiding the debris pile), and out amongs the rock buildings. Looking up and down the path they couldn’t see any sign of anyone, so they kept going toward the main road. They crossed the path and walked alongside the building across the street. It had the same open doorway as all the rest, and Luke could see a few remnants of some kind of furniture rotting away on the ground just inside. As they came up to the edge of that building they paused. They could keep going forward, directly toward the main road, but there wasn’t really any cover for them. Their other option was to turn right, and slink along the back side of that row of buildings, which would get them a little closer to a stand of trees that could provide them cover, which they could use to cross over to the main road. They went right.

As they main their way down the back sides of the buildings they were methodical. One step, always in unison, staying as closely packed as possible. They moved as a single organism. They were silent. Luke was sure no one could see or hear them.

They pressed on, past two more buildings. They were close to the stand of trees now, and they decided to cross the road. The sun was shining brightly as they did, but Luke looked down and noticed that they cast no shadow. 

It was 45 slow steps from the back of the building to the stand of trees; Luke counted them. The first 5 were extra slow. The next 30 were slow but steady. 35 down. 10 to go. They took one more, and that’s when Luke thought he saw a shadow move in the trees. He didn’t say anything because he was trying to keep silent, and since no one else seemed to see it, he assumed he was just seeing things. Perhaps it was just the wind fluttering the trees, causing the shadows to dance.

They took three more steps, and Luke saw nothing. Just the trees, a canopy of protection for them to use as they made their way to the main road, and hopefully away from this little village and to safety.

After the next step they all froze together. Luke watched as the hair on Austin’s neck stood on end. Owen held up his hand to make sure they knew to stay still. 

Ahead of them, something moved among the trees. It didn’t have a definite shape; it seemed to flow and fold, in and out of the dancing light beneath the trees. What _was_ clear were the footsteps that it made. Branches and leaves cracked and flicked beneath its feet as it walked. 

It moved back and forth, like it was pacing. Luke tried hard to focus on it, but every time he was just about to make out the shape it seemed to get blurry, or slip behind a tree. 

The boys still hadn’t moved; they had hardly breathed. They surely hadn’t made a move. That was part of why it was so horrifying when the thing suddenly stopped its pacing. It stopped its pacing, and started moving toward them. There was no question, it was headed right for them. 

_But it can’t see us._ Luke thought. _So what can it do?_ 

Still, there it was, coming right at them. There was nothing they could do but stay under the invisibility of the umbrella and hope that it wouldn’t see them.

It came closer and closer, crunching the leaves as it went. No matter how much closer it came, Luke still couldn’t get a good look at it. It just seemed to blend in with everything. 

Four steps closer it came to the four boys huddling under the umbrella, shivering together with fear as the person (or was it a creature?), paused before them. From this distance it seemed like more of a mirage, a wavy pattering in the air, like the shimmering of the street on a hot summer day, but in the outline of a person, or a flowy-shimmery-foldy person shape.

Luke held his breath, and the creature stood, frozen. There was no way for them to tell if it was actually looking at them, or could see them, or _sense_ them in any way. They couldn’t see any actual _parts_ of this thing.

Luke felt himself getting dizzy, and started to breath again. He closed his eyes so that he wouldn’t fall over, and that was the exact moment when it happened. Looking back, Luke wondered if he had his eyes closed for the most important moment of his life.

For it was at that exact moment, as soon as his lids touched, that an enormous _crack_ rang out in front of the boys. Joel and Austin later explained to Luke that at the moment of the crack it seemed that the air itself split in front of them, like someone opening a curtain. Through the curtain they could see some kind of room, with a fire, but it was distant, and hard to make out. Then, once the curtain was opened, the thing in front of them reached out, easily wrapping around Owen. Before Owen could even get out a yelp the thing slid through the curtain with him, and it closed again with another enormous _crack_.
