# 10: Travelers

The cool morning breeze gave the boys new energy as they walked South along the road toward Wrendale. It was a clear, bright morning, and despite the fact that their friend and brother was missing, the boys felt hopeful as they traveled the well-worn path.

To the left were miles of mostly open grasslands. Beyond the horizon were the forests they had left long ago, and between here and there were the occasional stand of trees among rolling hills, with creeks and streams filling the spaces between.

To their right the grasslands continued, though with higher hills and denser stands of trees. Those hills rose to meet the great mountains, which seemed to tower above them even at this distance. Atop the gray slopes the brilliant white peaks were painted gold in the early morning light. The wind up there was blowing out of the West, leaving the occasional trailing cloud dangling from the tips of the mountains. In several spots there were forests growing far up the sides of the mountains, and from this distance they resembled blankets pulled up on the lap of a giant.

Ahead of them the road stretched into the haze of the morning, meandering south toward the River, where it would turn toward the golden hills and finally make its way to Wrendale. The River was still many miles distant from the boys, and it would be some time before they could get there. 

It was mid-morning when the boys decided to take a break at the base of a birch that seemed to be popular with the local avians. As the boys sat in the shade the birds flitted and fluttered far above them, chattering and scolding one another. There seemed to be quite a commotion this morning. Luke imagined that it was a sort of county fair, with each bird telling the others what fun they would have if only they would stop by this attraction or the other, or maybe stop and have some kettle corn.

_Kettle corn_. Oh, how his stomach was aching! The boys had finished off the last of their snacks, and their canteens were all dangerously low. They would need to find food and water somewhere, but nothing on their map hinted at a location for either until they reached the river, many miles ahead. None of them mentioned it, but Luke wasn’t sure how they were going to make it.

Austin tilted his head back, trying to find a few more drops in his canteen. Luke wasn’t sure if he found any, but afterward he put canteen back in his bag and shook his head. “I don’t know how we’re going to make it,” he said. “We’re out of water, out of food. Yet we have so far to go.”

Joel just nodded somberly. 

Luke didn’t even nod. His spirits were sagging at the thought of walking for days without food or water. He didn’t know what to say. “We should probably keep going,” he said, mostly trying to convince himself. 

They all stood and shouldered their packs. The road was empty, and they traveled for several more hours without seeing anything more interesting than the occasional horse fly. The sun was high now, and their shirts were damp with sweat. There were only scrubby bushes here and there, mostly full of thorns; there wasn’t a tree in sight. And not only were there _not_ any creeks, streams, or ponds, the land seemed to be getting _drier_. The grass was yellowing, and the boys stirred up a small cloud of dust as they walked. The road seemed to shimmer a big far ahead of them as it approached the horizon. 

Luke’s left foot was sore. His ankle had blistered, and he wasn’t used to walking on such rocky ground. His stomach ached with hunger, and his mouth seemed drier than he could ever remember it being. He was in the middle of pondering the dust in his right eye when he heard Joel yell.

“Look! Look! There’s someone coming!” He was jumping and pointing. “There’s someone coming! We’re saved!”

“We aren’t _saved_,” hissed Austin. “We’re dead! Quick, we’ve got to find a place to hide, and hope they haven’t seen us.”

“What are you talking about?” Asked Joel. “We’re starving, and dying of thirst. We need food and water. We have to stop these people and ask for help.”

“This isn’t home, Joel.” Austin said sharply, his eyes scanning for a hiding place. “We can’t trust anyone here. We let our guard down and now Owen is gone, kidnapped. He may by dead for all we know. And if we let someone find us, we might soon wish we were dead.” His head was swiveling in all directions. Finally he pointed off to their left. “There. Those bushes. Run.”

Austin took off in a full sprint. Joel and Luke looked at each other, then followed. They ran toward a small clump of branches a few hundred feet from the road. Austin got there first and slid down next to them, and immediately cried out “Ow! Ow! Ow!” Luke and Joel realized why whey they arrived a few seconds later: the bushes were full of thorns.

Attempting to avoid the thorns, the boys all laid down on their stomachs, trying to stay close enough to the bushes to not be seen, yet able to see the road. 

“Austin, I don’t think this is a good idea,” Joel implored. “We should stop them, and see if they can help. We’re going to die without help.”

“No, we aren’t. We’ll figure something out,” Austin replied.

“This is a road to a _good_ place,” Joel insisted. “They will be good people.”

“They could be robbers, thieves, murderers, or worse! We don’t have any way of knowing who they are, or why they’re here. We don’t know anyone in this place. Keep your heads down.”

They were quiet for a while, watching the road. The travelers made their way slowly, and the boys were able to gradually see them come into detail. 

There was a horse pulling a sort of carriage. Luke thought it looked a lot like an old-west wagon, with canvas roof. The “roof” in this case was scarlet, and pentagonal in profile. It stretched the length of the wagon, and was high enough that the boys could have easily stood up in the wagon beneath it. The driver sat behind the horse, and appeared to be wearing a dark cloak. They could see no one else. 

“Austin, this is our only chance,” Joel whispered.

“Stay still,” he replied.

Joel looked at Luke. “We have to do something.”

Luke just shrugged. He was too tired to know what to do.

As the traveler grew closer the boys could see more clearly. It _wasn’t exactly_ a horse that pulled the wagon. It was a lot like a horse, but not quite right. The ears were too big, and face was too long. As the mouth were tusks, and Luke was pretty sure that he could see fangs. The eyes were a glowing sort of green. 

The wagon slowly approached the spot in the road where the boys had left it, but the driver didn’t seem to have noticed (or cared), and the wagon kept moving ahead without changing pace. 

Austin leaned out to get a better look. “They’re almost gone. Not too much longer and we’ll be able to sneak back and get out of — Joel, No!”

Luke looked to the other side of the bushes, where Joel was laying down. But Joel wasn’t there, he was up and sprinting toward the wagon, arms waving. He was shouting, “Help, help! Please, help!”

Luke watched, stunned. He couldn’t believe that Joel had just up and left them. 

At first it didn’t seem as though the traveler could hear him. The wagon rolled on without wavering. But as Joel drew nearer to the wagon the driver turned toward him. The hood of his cloak cast a shadow that covered his face such that Luke couldn’t see it. He pulled on the reigns and the horse-like creature slowed and the wagon came to a stop. All the while Joel was still sprinting and waving and shouting. 

The wagon had stopped, but the traveler didn’t move. He just seemed to stare at Joel, his cloak unmoving atop the wagon. 

Joel arrived near the wagon and fell to his knees. Luke was pretty sure he was asking for help, but he was too far away now to hear for sure what was being said. He could see that Joel was pleading with the traveler, but the traveler still did not move. Joel sat back on his knees, his arms now at his side. He must have told the traveler his story, Luke thought, and now he’s waiting for an answer.

Slowly, the traveler stood up and pulled back the arm of his cloak. His arm, pale white, reached toward the seat next to him and picked up and object. He lifted the object up toward Joel. It took Luke a moment to realize what it was: a crossbow, pointed at Joel’s heart. 

Luke’s heart lept into his throat. He jumped up to run. But, before he could take a second step, he was tackled from behind and a dark hood was pulled down over his head. He struggled against his assailant, trying to break free. He felt a grip loosen on his arm, and was about to roll away when he felt the cold edge of a blade against his neck. Recognizing the situation he was, he relented, and became a prisoner.
