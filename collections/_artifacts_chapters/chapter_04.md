# 4: A  Small Figure

Owen watched in horror as Luke tripped. The hog was nearly on top of him, his huge tusks slashing through the air as he charged. He closed his eyes. But instead of the screams he expected to hear as the hog shredded and stomped his best friend, all he heard was the grunting and snorting (and kwa-thumping) as it bounded away down the road.

Owen opened his eyes and looked around. The noise of the hog grew quieter, and silence fell upon the side of the road where he was hiding behind some low bushes. 

“Joel!” Owen shouted. “Joel!”

“I’m over here!” came a voice to his left. He walked a few dozen feet in that direction and looked around. 

“I’m up here,” the voice said.

Owen looked up. There, at the very top of a huge pine tree, was Joel, sitting comfortably in the crook of a branch. Owen let out a huge sigh.

“I’m so glad you’re okay, Joel! Did you see what happened to Luke?” It felt like he had to yell for Joel to hear him, he was so high up.

“I did. Hang on and I’ll get down from here,” Joel replied. He deftly made his way down the tree, sliding from branch to branch. There was one spot about half way up where he had to shimmy around the entire trunk to find a footing, but he did it easily. A few moments later and he landed in front of Owen, a sly grin on his face.

“Is he dead?” Owen asked, soberly.

“No, no way! He fell over the side of the road, and rolled down the embankment. I watched him go. He seemed to manage to dodge the trees, but I couldn’t see where he ended up.”

“We should go over there and check it out.”

“I agree.”

Together they walked over to the spot where the hog had nearly gored Luke. Somehow he had managed to jump out of the way just in time. Unfortunately, that jump had been in the direction of a steep embankment, and it seemed that he had rolled down the whole thing.

From where they were standing, neither of them could see all the way too the bottom. It was just too far down; there were too many trees in the way.

“Luke!” Owen yelled. “Luke! Are you down there?” His voice echoed through the forest.

Joel leaned toward the edge, his eyes closed tight, listening intently. They each held their breath. No response.

“Luke!” Joel tried. “Luuuuuuke!”

Nothing.

Joel and Owen looked at each other, eyes wide with concern.

“What do we do?” Joel asked.

“We keep going,” Owen answered. We can’t climb down there, it’s too steep to do safely. We should follow the road for a while, see if there’s an area where it’s easier to get down. Maybe we can find them then. 

“Alright. Let’s go.” Joel looked around. “Hey Owen, where’s your backpack?”

Owen looked around. It wasn’t anywhere in sight. He frowned. “I had to leave it on the ground when the hog charged. He must have knocked it out of the way as he came through. Oh man, I hope the umbrella is still ok.”

“I’ll help you look,” Joel said.

Together they looked all around, up and down the road, dodging pinecones as they went. They looked on the left side, then they came back the right side. They checked under every bush, behind every tree. They found nothing. A few times they stopped to shout “Luuuuuke”, but they never heard a reply.

Exhausted, Joel threw himself on the ground and stared up at the sky. There, hanging from a branch about 50 feet off the ground, was Owen’s backpack.

Joel laughed. He laughed and laughed and laughed. He laughed so hard he cried. Great rivers of tears. He thought about Luke getting lost, and he cried some more. Then he laughed again, and cried a bit.

Owen came over, looking rather cross. “How can you be laughing at a time like this, Joel? It’s not funny! We have to find my bag! What are we going to do without the artifact!”

Joel was still laughing. His sides were hurting from laughing so hard, but he couldn't stop. He managed to get his arm out and point up at the tree.

Owen followed his arm and saw the bag. Now he, too, couldn’t stop laughing. He fell on the ground next to Joel, and together they laughed until they ran completely out of breath.

“How are we going to get that down?” Owen finally asked, breathlessly.

“Oh, that’ll be easy,” Joel replied.

He hopped up and grabbed onto the trunk, near the bottom. Owen watched in amazement as he scampered up the tree, reaching the backpack in only a couple of minutes. He put it on his back, sliding back down even faster than he had climbed. When he reached the bottom he took the bag off and handed it to Owen.

“Wow,” Owen said. “And, thanks.”

“No problem,” said Joel.

“Alright, let’s get going,” Owen said.

They started off down the path, in the direction they had been heading before. They road was climbing pretty steeply in this area, and it wasn’t long before they found themselves walking with a steep cliff to one side, with a nearly sheer rock face on the other. 

The sun was getting lower in the sky, and it was clear they were going to have to find a place to spend the night eventually. Neither of them wanted to admit it though. They were missing their friends; it wasn’t the same without Luke and Austin. It seemed that both of them were of the same mind: keep going, try to find Luke or Austin, no matter how long it took.

Joel’s legs were starting to ache. They came around a bend to the right, and before them was yet another fairly steep climb up. Joel sat down on a rock away from the drop off. He pulled off his backpack and opened it and took out a water bottle. It was about half full. He opened it and took a swallow, then stared down at his backpack while he rested his legs. Suddenly he yelped.

“Owen!” He shouted.

Owen jumped up, startled. “What is it?”

“The map! The map! Why didn’t we think of it before!? We might be able to see them!”

Owen jumped up with excitement. “Of course! We must have been too tired to think of it! Quick, get it out”

Joel ripped open his backpack and pulled out the bronze tube. He opened it in one motion and pulled out the parchment and kneeled, laying it on the ground between the two of them. Owen dropped down and stared. Together they scanned the surface, looking for any sign of movement that could be there friends. 

Owen pointed to a spot where something had moved in the trees. “There! What’s that?”

“That can’t be it,” Joel replied. “That’s too far away. They couldn’t be that far if they had wings.”

Owen frowned. 

They kept looking, and looking. Joel’s eyes were getting painfully dry, but he didn’t dare blink, in case he missed something. But he couldn’t see _anything_. Owen was staring just as intently. 

Then, in the woods at the bottom of the cliff, not too far from where they were, Joel thought he saw something move. He didn’t say anything though, because he didn’t want to be wrong. Maybe he had just imagined it. 

He blinked. Then stared again, at the same spot. Again, something moved. Something human-sized. Just big enough to see it move, but too small to make out much more than that.

“There!” Joel shouted, pointing. “Right there! What’s that?”

Owen moved over next to Joel to get a better look. Together they leaned in, their noses nearly touching the surface of the map. Joel smelled the sweet scent of pine as they did.

They watched intently. At first, nothing happened. Then, as they watched, they saw a small figure move out of the woods and into a clearing. It paused, as thought it was considering what to do. It took a few steps forward and stopped again. There was no question, this was a person. They watched as the person turned to the left, and moved back into the trees. 

Joel let out a yell. “Yea! That’s one of them! And whoever it is, he isn’t that far from us. He’s down at the bottom of this valley. We’re headed in the same direction. If we keep going down this road we should eventually be able to meet up!”

“Let’s get moving,” Owen said. 

Joel packed up the parchment and they started again, moving at a quick pace. It wasn’t long before the road made another bend to the right and started to descend. Down and down it went, switching back and forth as it did. Left, right, left they turned, following the road down to lower elevation. As they did so the sun got lower and lower. It was nearly dark now, but up ahead it seemed to be a little brighter.

They pushed on toward the light, and suddenly the forest ended, and they entered a huge valley.  It was took dark to see very far, but near the horizon they could see the golden tips of mountains, glowing in the sunset. 

“We need to find a place to sleep for the night,” Joel said.

“Ugh,” Owen replied. “I was hoping we would find them before nightfall, but I think you’re right. We’re never going to find anyone in the dark. There doesn’t seem to be a moon tonight.” He furrowed his brow. “I wonder if there even _is_ a moon here. Let’s go on just a bit farther.”

Together they wandered down the road a bit. The road had turned right, staying close to the edge of the forest. As it got darker the noises from the forest grew louder, like an orchestra warming up for the night. Joel thought to himself that he’d prefer to be indoors when the main performance finally began. 

It wasn’t much farther down the road that they suddenly found themselves not far from of a collection of huge boulders. 

“Maybe there’s a place near those rocks we can rest,” Joel said.

“Yeah, let’s check it out,” said Owen.

They moved closer, but slowly, not sure what might be hiding among the rocks. As they got closer they realized that these weren’t rocks, but _buildings_. Large stone buildings, made to look like huge boulders. 

Joel and Owen looked at one another. Owen put is finger to his lips. Joel nodded.

They moved toward the first building, walking slowly around it. It looked ancient, weathered over eons. There was a soft coating of moss on the surface, which Joel noticed seemed to stretch out toward him as he got close. They found a door way on the far side, but this building had clearly been empty for quite some time.

They stepped through the doorway. Inside the floor was covered with leaves, and a thick musty scent seemed to hang in the air. The interior was essentially one giant room, and nearly empty. There were some sticks piled up in one corner, and what seemed to have been a shelf dangled from a wall. Other than that this building was deserted.

They slowly made their way through the other buildings, trying to get a look before it became fully dark. They decided to use a few minutes of the flashlight battery. The other buildings were all empty as well, though several had more evidence of past habitation. A few even had old furniture in them. They decided to look through that in the morning. 

They elected to put down their sleeping bags in the last building they found. There were a few large branches on the ground inside, and they were able to prop them up in the doorway to create a make-shift barrier there. 

Joel wanted to make a fire, but Owen said it was too dangerous. Until they knew more about what came out at night, and whether it was attracted to fire or not, they needed to keep silent, and dark.

So, they did. They set down their packs and slid inside their sleeping bags. Owen pulled out an umbrella from his bag and opened it, then set it between them so that it mostly covered both of them. They thought at first about taking shifts keeping watch, but then they decided that if something was going to find them in the dark and attack them, they’d rather not even see it coming. 

Joel was staring up in the dark at the stone ceiling that he knew was above him. Outside he could hear the noise of the forest, louder than ever with strange noises. 

“Owen, do you think Luke and Austin are ok?”

“I don’t know Joel. I sure hope so.”
