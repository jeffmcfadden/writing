# 6: Meeting

Joel awoke with a start, jumping out of his sleeping bag and poking his eye on the umbrella in the process. He yelped, and threw punches at the two figures he could see in the dim light with his one good eye. They dodged his flailing attempts easily, and he toppled over onto Owen as his feet got tangled up in his sleeping bag.

“Ow! Hey! What the!?” Yelled Owen. “Joel, what’s going on?” He looked up and saw the figures in the doorway, silhouetted against the early morning light. “Hey! Who goes there?” He pushed Joel aside (“Ow!”) and pulled out his pocket knife, leaping to his feet and waving it all around the air next to him.

The figures took a step back, and Owen realized as he flailed that they knew his name. They were yelling it, actually.

“Owen! Owen! Calm down! It’s us!” The first figured shouted.

Owen paused for a second and his eyes finished adjusting. After they did he had to rub them a few times, because he couldn’t believe what he was seeing.

There, in the doorway before him, were Luke and Austin.

Owen stood, his mouth open, stunned. Joel, who by this point had started to recover from being poked in the eye, realized who was in the doorway. He jumped up and leapt at them, talking both of them in a huge bear hug.

“Luke! Austin!” He shouted. “You’re here! You’re here! Oh my, is it really even you?”

Luke and Austin both laughed. “Oh, it’s us,” said Luke.

“Oh, I didn’t think we’d ever see you again!” Joel cried. There were tears in the corners of his eyes. “I’m so glad you’re back!”

“We’re glad to be back,” said Austin.

Owen managed to pry himself out of his stupor. “I can’t believe it! I can’t believe you found us!” He turned to Austin. “Listen, Aust,” he started to say.

Austin interrupted, “I’m sorry I left. I’m sorry I got so mad at you. I never should have left you guys.”

“No,” said Owen. “It was my fault. I shouldn't have been such a jerk. We could have found another way to work it out. I’m sorry.”

Owen threw his arms around his brother and gave him a huge bear hug. Then he grabbed Luke around the shoulders, picked him up, and gave him the biggest hug he could muster. He tripped and they fell down again. Joel laughed and jumped on them, tackling them. Austin joined in with a belly flop onto Joel’s back, squishing everyone beneath.

There were groans and shouts aplenty. “Ugh!” “Ow!” “Okay, okay, get off!”

Eventually they all managed to get clear of one another. They sat down on the sleeping bags, and Joel turned to Luke and Austin. “What happened with you guys after you left? How did you meet up? How did you get here?”

Luke and Austin took turns filling in the various parts of the story, from getting lost in the woods, to the quilled hog, to the giant bear, the crunching and the bones, to the leading of the compass. Owen and Joel listening intently, asking for detail as they went. When they had finished recounting every detail, Owen picked up his bag and started rummaging through it.

“I brought this for a special occasion, and I can’t think of a better one that for us all to be reunited,” he said. He pulled out a thermos from his backpack, along with a few packets of hot chocolate mix. They each pulled a cup out of their own bags, and Owen poured them all a hot cup of hot chocolate. Luke thought it was strange that a thermos could keep water warm this long, but the hot chocolate tasted too good to ask any questions.

They sipped noisily and happily until every last drop was gone. 

“Ahhhh,” someone said. Or maybe all of them said.

They sat in silence now. Someone sighed.

“Well, what do we do now?” Asked Joel, looking at the others.

“Well, the compass led us here,” said Luke. “And, since we got here, it doesn’t seem to be pointing us toward anywhere else. Which, is kind of strange. We already met the two of you here, what else could we need to do?”

“Maybe the compass is taking a break,” said Austin. “We could just get back on the road. Keep walking; maybe try to follow the map for once.” There was a bit of an edge to his voice. But, he caught himself, and softened. “I mean, if that’s what everyone wants to do.”

Owen stood up, and Austin seemed to tense. “No, that’s not it. Well, not exactly,” he said. “I don’t think we’ve found everything we were supposed to find here. Not yet, anyway.” He started to walk toward the old broken furniture, on the other side of the room.

He approached what looked like it might have been a desk once. It was made of wood, but one side of it seemed to have been smashed, and what must have once been the top was now leaning on the floor. The other side still had a semblance of drawers. Owen pulled at the top most one. It flew open and out of his hand, landing on the floor in a crash of dust and splinters, but nothing else. 

“Oops,” Owen grinned sheepishly. 

“Try the other ones,” Joel suggested.

He tried the next drawer down, a bit more gently this time. It came out, again empty. He tossed it aside and tried the bottom drawer. It, too, was empty. He tossed it into the pile and moved on toward the other hunk of decrepit furniture. 

This other stack of boards was even more decayed. Maybe it had been some kind of wardrobe, or fancy bookshelf, or maybe something else altogether. Whatever it was, they all took turns dismantling it, piece by piece, trying to see if there was anything interesting hidden inside. They found nothing but rusty nails.

“Dang,” Owen said. “I was _sure_ there must be something here for us.” He frowned, looking down and starting at the piles of debris scattered around the room now.

The other boys stared as well, quietly considering the furniture they’d finished dismantling. “What a bunch of junk,” Austin said. He walked over and gave the old drawers a bit of a kick, just to make the point. 

But as he did so, there was an odd shhh-thuck noise that seemed to come from the drawer. The boys all looked up at each other.

“Did you hear that?” Joel asked.

“I did,” said Luke.

Austin jumped on the drawer and picked up, turning it over and over in his hands. As he turned it side to side it again made that shhhh-thuck.

“There’s something in here!” He shouted. “Quick, Owen, give me your knife.”

Owen passed his knife to Austin, and Austin started to pry at the bottom of the drawer. He got the tip of the knife under the edge and managed to pry up the corner a bit. As he did, it became clear that the entire bottom was actually a false bottom. There was a whole compartment under it. He pried hard with the knife, and the board lifted out, exposing the compartment beneath. He turned over the drawer, and something fell out, leaving a small cloud of dust in its wake. Austin bent down and picked it up. It was a small, leather-bound book. He opened it up. The other boys could see that it was some kind of journal, full of neat, hand-written pages.

“Whoa,” he said after scanning the first few pages. He thumbed though a few more, his eyes getting bigger as he did. Finally, he shut the book and looked up. “Guys, you are not going to believe what we just found.”
