# 9: A Walk

Austin yelled, “Owen! Owwwennnnn!” He raced out from under the umbrella toward the spot where the air had split like a curtain. He waved and grasped frantically at the air, trying to get a hold on something that he hoped was there, but invisible. But he found nothing. Just the cool air, in the shadow of the trees.

He sat down on the leaves and put his head in his hands. The other boys looked at one another, each of them with the stunned look of disbelief on his face. 

“Guys, what _was_ that?” Joel asked. 

After a long pause, Luke answered, quietly, “I have no idea. It seemed like some kind of _creature_. One that can open and close hidden portals, and see invisible people. 

“Obviously,” said Austin. He looked up at Luke and Joel with red eyes. “This is horrible. What are we going to do now?”

“We can’t stay here,” said Luke. “We don’t know what that thing was, or if it’s coming back. We need to find a safe place where we can figure out what is going on, and where Owen is, so we can rescue him and get out of here.”

Austin whined, forlornly, “There’s nowhere safe. Not anywhere. This is the most dangerous place in the universe. We’ll never find Owen. We should just go home.”

Joel opened the top of his bag and reached inside, pulling out a small tube. “That’s not exactly true,” he said. He unrolled the map in front of them, and pointed at a tiny dot above some rolling hills. “Here. At the base of the mountains, in the golden hills. _Wrendale_. Founded ages ago by the Elves. It’s a safe place, and someone there will know where we can find help.”

“Elves aren’t _safe_,” said Austin. 

“They might not be _safe_,” said Joel, “but they aren’t enemies, and Wrendale has been a welcome respite for travelers for eons. At least, that’s what the Almanac said.” 

“How far is that?” Luke asked.

“About four days’ walk,” Joel replied. “We could do it in a day if we had horses.”

“Horses!” Austin scoffed. “We don’t even have enough _food_ left for four days. Let alone something to ride on.”

They all looked at each other. Austin was right. They had enough food for maybe a day. If they were going to make it through a journey this long, they were going to have to find a source of food. And they were going to have to do that in a land that had so far only given them killer hogs and trolls. 

“Does anyone have a better idea?” Joel asked. “Because we can’t stay here. We’ll just get captured by another one of those shimmery air-creatures, and then we’ll be done-for. We’ve gotta get out of here, and we need to do it quickly.”

Luke thought it over. “I agree,” he said slowly. “We don’t have any better options. We can’t even get out of the realm in less than two or three days, and I don’t want to go anywhere without Owen. I saw we go to Wrendale. From there we should have a better idea of what to do after that.” He looked down at Austin. “Aust, this is our best hope. Let’s do it.”

Austin sat in silence, still staring at the ground ahead of him. He was so still, for so long, Luke started to wonder if he had fallen asleep. Finally, he took a deep breath, and stood up. He looked from Luke to Joel, and back again. “Alright. Let’s go.”

They walked through the woods to the other side, and beyond to the main road going West. As they made their way to the main road Luke had the idea to get out the compass. It had served as a guide for them many times before, maybe it could help them again. But this time when he pulled it out there was no shimmering dot. He spun around several times, until he was dizzy, and it couldn’t get the dot to show up. He tried is slow, the fast again. So fast that he fell down. Nothing. Just N, E, S, W.  After that he closed the compass and put it back into his bag.

They passed most of the journey in silence. Here and there one of them would pick up a rock and throw it as far as he could, or maybe at a bird nearby, but the birds always escaped unharmed. They all missed Owen, and none of them felt much like talking. 

The way was easy, much easier than the road through the forest. This road was mostly straight, and flat. There were only a few trees scattered here or there. The occasional clump of bushes hid small creatures that would scamper away amongst the leaves as the boys trampled past, but they saw few living things along the way.

The sun was warm, and by mid day they had to stop in the shade of a lone tree to drink. Their water bottles were nowhere near full enough for a 4 day journey, but none of them said so out loud. After a brief rest, they each had a few bites of a snack from their pack, and they continued on. 

The rest of the day passed without incident. Luke was thankful for this, but found it strange at the same time. Everywhere they had gone before they had seen strange creatures; and often those strange creatures had attacked them. But on this journey they had seen almost nothing. A few buzzing insects, a far-off bird, and maybe a lizard diving under some leaves. It seemed too good to be true, and it made Luke wonder what was waiting to come out in the dark.

As the sun began to get low in the sky they came upon a small wood. It was mostly along the right side of the road as they approached it, though a few trees could be found on the left. 

“This could be a good place to spend the night,” Austin said.

“I agree,” said Joel. “It provides a bit of cover if we stay off the road a ways.”

“Hey, what’s that?” Asked Luke. He was pointing at something sticking up out of the ground at the edge of the road, about half way along the wood. “It looks like a... sign.”

The boys all looked at each other and then broke out in a run. They sprinted to the object, skidding to a halt in front of is as they gasped, out of breath. 

It was, indeed, a sign. Fastened to the top of a wooden pole, right along the road, it pointed to their left, and had a single word carved into it. _Wrendale_ The boys followed the arrow and realized that they were at a fork in the road. They had made it to the road to Wrendale after all. They were a day closer to finding help, to rescuing Owen.

Buoyed by their discovery, they pitched their tent with new energy, though they stayed far away from the edge of the road, just in case someone were to come along in the night. 

Dusk had fallen, and they didn’t dare start a fire, so they ate more snacks in silence before going to bed with rumbling stomachs, but happy hearts; it felt like they just might find their way to Owen after all.

* * * 

They slept soundly and deeply, and the night passed without incident. In the light of dawn they quietly packed up their things and made their way carefully toward the road, looking and listening for anyone, or any _thing_ that might be waiting for them.

They found nothing, and as they crossed out of the wood onto the road to Wrendale in the cool morning air, they could see the morning light gleaming on the white peaks of the mountains. 

What they didn’t see was the pair of eyes in the trees, beneath a dark hood, watching them as they went.
