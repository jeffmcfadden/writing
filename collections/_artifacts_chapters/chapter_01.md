# 1: The Silver Compass

A stick cracked noisily under Luke’s foot as he marched along the path between the trees. 

The four boys stopped suddenly, pausing for a moment to listen for any sign of activity around them. They heard nothing.

“Shhh!” Shushed Joel, his younger brother. “Who knows what might be lurking in these woods!”

“Sorry,” whispered Luke.

They continue on, winding up one hillside and down another. Luke was confident he could find his way back, but it seemed to be getting later in the afternoon. Finding their way back in the dark seem unlikely.

Luke shuffled ahead to the boy at the front of the line and whispered from behind him. 

“Owen, are we there yet?”

“Not yet,” the boy in front replied. “But almost.”

Luke settled back in third position, behind Joel. He looked behind him at the other boy, the one in the back of the line.

“Austin, is this place even _real_?” He asked incredulously.

“Oh, it’s real, Luke. As real as anything you’ve ever touched with your own fingers, seen with your own eyes, or heard with your own ears.”

Luke shrugged, and they continued silently along the path.

After another mile or so, they came left around a bend, and ahead Luke could see two massive oak trees, one on either side of the path. Together they created a sort of arched bough. Luke thought it looked like an entrance to a theme park maybe. Beyond the arch looked to be a clearing, and as they approached the trees he could see beyond them a green meadow, with knee high grass. 

As they crossed under the arch Luke felt a strange sensation, like the hair on his arms and neck was standing up. He glanced down, but all the hair was in place. He looked at the other boys.

“Did you guys feel that?” He whispered. 

They all nodded.

Owen led them forward, into the meadow. He arrived at the center and abruptly stopped.

Luke looked around. The meadow was circular, a perfect circle it seemed to him. All around the edges were dense clusters of trees. Oak, Pine, Fir, and so many more that he couldn’t name. They were so dense that he couldn’t see more than a few feet beyond the border. The only break in the circle was the archway they came in from.

Owen knelt, and brushed away the dirt in the center of the circle. Beneath it was a pentagon of stone, perfectly smooth on top. Luke reached out to touch it, but Austin grabbed his arm and shook his head at Luke. Luke pulled his arm back to his side.

Owen continued to clean off the top of the stone in silence. As he did so, more of it was revealed. It wasn’t just a pentagon of stone a few inches thick, as Luke first thought. It was a rather substantial structure, at least a few feet tall. Deep red-brown in color, with flecks of black and gold in the surface, the top was like a table, overhanging the base by a few inches. All along the under-side of the top was a ridge.

Luke moved closer and noticed faint writing etched into the surface of the top. As he stared at it it seemed to get cleared, more defined, and deeper.

_When the four come together, the fifth will be revealed._

The hair on Luke’s arm really was standing on end now.

Once the stone had been cleaned, the other three boys stepped around it, each taking up a position opposite another. Owen was at the “top”, with Joel on the “left”, Austin on the “right”, and now Luke at the “bottom”.

Luke watched as the three boys placed one hand under the edge of the tap, grasping the ridge. Owen nodded to Luke, and he instinctually followed, grabbing the ridge on his side. As he did that he found that the ridge was molded with small polished finger-slots. It was a perfect fit for his hand. Somehow he knew the other slots must be perfectly formed for the other boys’ hands. 

Owen counted down with the fingers of his free hand: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Simultaneously, the boys pulled on their side of the structure. 

Noiselessly the top of the structure began to move. Four pieces, equal in size, began to separate. Their seams were so perfectly formed that Luke couldn’t tell that the top wasn’t one solid piece at first. As the parts separated, a small opening was revealed in the top. The boys kept pulling, and slowly the top moved apart, until it seemed to settled into a slot with a solid, firm _click_. 

At the instant of the _click_, Luke sensed that something had changed. He looked around at the circle and noticed that the forest beyond the edge seemed to no longer be dark, but kind of fuzzy, like he was looking through the heat shimmer above asphalt on a hot summer day. It was almost dizzying to look at. Luke couldn’t explain why, but he was sure that nothing beyond that fuzzy limit could see or hear them now.

“The four have come together,” Owen said. The other boys grinned. “We have waited a long time for this day, Luke. We’ve traveled that path many times with other boys, but we’ve never made it all the way to the Stone. Today, we made it. We made it because you are the Fourth. You are the one we’ve been waiting for.”

Luke tried to smile while he stomach did some loops within him. 

“What does that mean, the Fourth?” He croaked.

“It means that you are an Artifact Keeper. And this,” Austin gestured at the compartment in the top of the stone, “is your artifact.”

Luke leaned over the top of the stone and looked into the compartment. Inside was a small, smooth wooden box. Engraved on the surface was a silver “4”. He reached inside and took out the box, setting it on the surface of the table. It was heavier than he expected it to be.

“Open it,” Joel said.

Luke looked at the box. It was a simple box, with two interlocking pieces, a top and a bottom. He pulled on the top and it smoothly came off. He set the top on the table.

Inside was a compass, one that would fit neatly in his hand. It was made of a brilliant silver, with a black dial so dark it seemed to suck in all the light around it. The needle was made of two opposing triangles, one gold, the other the same black of the dial.

Luke picked it up and examined it further. Like any compass he had held, the dial contained 4 letters you would expect: “N”, “E”, “S”, and “W”. Each was of a gold just like that covering the needle.

What was strange about this compass though, was how the letters were arranged. “N” wasn’t at the top, but at about the 2 o’clock position. “E” was at about the 4 o’clock position, “S” at the 7 o’clock position, and “W” at the 10 o’clock position. 

Then, at the very top, was a single circle, rimmed with gold and filled with a red so deep Luke didn’t think it could have a name. 

Luke picked up the compass. It felt sure in his hand, like it belonged there. As he stared down at it he did a slow circle in place, watching the need all the time. As he made his way around the needle pointed at the direction he was facing, “W” first, toward the sun, then “S”, “E”, and “N.” He turned again toward the sun, but the needle jumped right over the dot to the “W”, so quickly Luke wasn’t sure it ever cross it at all.

“What _is_ this?” He asked to no one in particular.

“_That_ is how we find our way in,” Austin replied. 

Luke looked at it again, and felt a bit like some rocks had settled in his stomach. It had all sounded like fun when they had talked to him about it at first, but now he wasn’t so sure.

“Guys,” he said, “are you sure about this? Shouldn’t we tell someone what we’ve found? You know, ask an adult or something?”

The other boys just stared back.

“We were called for this, Luke. It isn’t an accident. Telling an adult wouldn’t help. They wouldn’t believe us, anyway. We’re here because we’re _supposed_ to be here. That’s why the stone opened. That’s why the compass is in your hand.”

Luke looked down at the compass again, shining brilliantly in the fading sun.

Owen took the box from the top of the table and placed it back into the compartment. The other boys all took up their positions, and together they closed the stone top. At the moment it closed, the fuzziness surrounding them disappeared. No one spoke.

Owen led them back out of the clearing, under the arch they came through. As they went under Owen re-ordered them so that Luke was in the front, then Owen, Joel and Austin. They continued back on the path they had come. The path was clear, so Luke didn’t have any trouble finding the way. They walked in silence, same as they had come in. 

As they walked Luke glanced down at the silver compass in his hand, watching as the direction they walked was reflected in the dial. 

Up one hillside, down another, around a bend here, another there. “N”, “W”, “S”, “W”, “N”, etc.

They had been walking for about 10 minutes when they came around a bend and found themselves at a fork in the road. Luke stopped, confused, because he couldn’t remember a fork in the road. In fact, he didn’t remember _any_ paths leading off the main path, not even small animal tracks, let alone a fork.

The fork veered off to the right, and the woods seemed to darken as it did. Luke felt the hair on his neck standing up again. He turned back to look at the other boys, unsure of what to do. 

Joel gestured toward his hand, the one with the compass in it.

Luke lifted his arm up, and held the compass in front of him. He was facing the fork in the road, and the compass was oriented with the red dot at the top.

Luke looked closely at the gold needle. It was pointing at the red dot, and the dot was shimmering.
