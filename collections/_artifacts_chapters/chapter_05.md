# 5: Crunching

After some rest Luke and Austin started walking again. They decided to follow the red dot, just as Luke had been doing, but they were much more cautious. While Luke held the compass and directed them, Austin was on the lookout for suspicious looking areas or creatures. They also took frequent breaks to listen for movement, or any other noises, close or distant.

They walked for a long time, and never did run into any more bears, or really anything scarier than a moth with a 2-inch long stinger, though even the moth didn’t seem interested in them.

Not long after they passed the moth they found another road. The red dot told them to go left onto it, so they did. From that point it seemed to direct them right down the road, slowly weaving back and forth through the woods along with it.

As they went they noticed that it finally seemed to be getting darker, and they realized they were going to need to find a place to sleep. Unfortunately, without Joel’s map, they had no idea where they were or what was nearby. They took a break and sat by the road, eating some snacks they had packed. They had left home pretty quickly, so they didn’t have much to eat, but between them they had a few apples, some pop tarts, a few bags of skittles, and a couple of water bottles. It wasn’t much, but it kept them going.

After their “dinner” they walked further along the road in search of a place to sleep. Austin had brought a small tarp in his bag that they could use as a sort of roof or wall, and they each had a sleeping bag in their packs, but sleeping out in the open seemed dangerous. They had already run into a giant snake and an angry bear. Who could guess what would come out at night?

They continued walking down the road. They were just beginning to give up hope of finding a good place to hunker down for the night when the road bent to the right. Along its edge there was a face of rock. Luke noticed it first, and together they cut through the trees towards its base. They wandered carefully along its edge for a while, wary of anything that might be hiding in wait. A few hundred feet from the road they found what they were looking for: a small cleft in the rock created a bit of an overhang, and beneath it was a flat space large enough for them to both lay out on. It wasn’t really a cave; it wasn’t deep enough. But it would keep them dry in case of rain, and it kept them up off the forest floor a few feet,  hopefully away from whatever creeping things came out at night here.

They took Austin’s tarp and some rope and secured it to the face of the rock to create a makeshift wall for themselves, then they set their sleeping bags out and climbed inside. They were both exhausted, but neither of them really wanted to sleep.

Luke broke the initial silence. “Where did you go when you left us, Aust?”

“Well, at first I just meant to go into the forest for a few minutes, then come back. I was just so mad at Owen for refusing to go to the Lake. He always wants to be the boss of me. So I wandered into the woods for a few minutes and sat down. I started to realized that it wasn’t fair of me to just leave everyone; I should stick with the party. Even though I was upset with Owen I shouldn’t have gotten so angry, and I shouldn’t have left. So, I got up and started to head back to the road, but I got turned around. After a while I realized I was lost and I figured I should start following the sun. So, I did that until I came to that meadow’s edge. I saw the bear in there, and was trying to figure out where to go next when I saw you break through the trees and nearly run right into it. That’s when I got out the stopwatch.”

“Wow. Good thing you did!”

“Yeah. It’s funny, the whole day I was trying to follow the sun, but every once in a while I had a feeling like I needed to change direction a bit. Kind of like something was telling me where to go, deep down inside. I think that’s how I found you. Do you think that’s crazy?”

“I think there’s a lot about this place that we don’t understand. Nothing seems crazy anymore.”

“Yeah.”

They both lay in silence for a while, listening to the rising chorus of noises out in the forest. Luke imagined what the stars outside must look like. He couldn’t see them through all the trees, even if he _had_ gone outside, but he was sure they wouldn’t look like the stars at home. His mind wandered to the conflict between Owen and Austin earlier in the day, and their desire to go to different places.

“Hey Aust?”

“What?”

“What do you think we’d find at the Lake?”

“Treasure beyond our wildest dreams.”

“Do you think we’d just be able to pick it up and take it home, and be rich?”

“I dunno.”

“I think I’d like to visit that Lake,” Luke said through a yawn.

“Me too, Luke. Me too.”



Luke awoke, disoriented, in the dark, to the sound of chewing. It was so loud and close he thought for a moment that he must have woke himself up by eating rocks in his sleep. His eyes focused, and he realized there was a very dim light in their little home, coming from Austin’s bag somewhere. He could see just enough of Austin’s face to see that he was holding his finger up to his lips, his eyes open wide.

The chewing continued, with booming crunches that sounded like the shattering of tree trunks. The crunching was interspersed with slurping, coughing, belching, and  what seemed like laughing. From time to time Luke thought he might have heard deep grunts, and even some talking, though he recognized no words being spoken. 

Luke and Austin stayed motionless, listening to the feast going on right outside. At one point the wind must have shifted a bit, because a horrendous stench wafted into their nook. Luke thought he was going to barf for sure. At the last moment the odor abated, and he was able to keep his skittles from scedattling. 

The odor drifted away, but the crunching continue for a long time. Eventually it slowed, as did the grunts. Then a strange, thunderous, _thumping_ took place. It echoed through the forest, and was so close it caused their tarp-door to flutter. Thankfully it was loud enough that no one could have heard the squeaks they both let out in surprise as the rock shook around them. 

After that tremendous _thump_ there was a small bit of grunting, followed by yet another _thump_, though this one wasn’t _quite_ as close. Then there was another, and another, those ones just a bit quieter than the others. All in all there were six _thumps_ that night, and then complete silence.

Luke and Austin stared at each other, but didn’t say a word. Not sure what to do they silently slid their bags closer together, and tried to stay awake, leaning on the rock wall. But after the day that had preceded them it wasn’t long before they succumbed to their exhaustion, and fell asleep.

Luke was awakened by Austin sometime after first light. Austin had his finger over his lips again. When Luke’s eyes finally adjusted, he nodded in understanding, and Austin gestured to the edge of the tarp wall. Luke followed him over, being careful not to make any noise, and peaked outside.

Just outside their nook was a massive pile of bones, at least 8 feet high. Next to the bones were the smoldering ashes of a fire. Surrounding the bones and fire were six deep impression in the dirt, as if six boulders had been dropped from a great height, then picked back up and moved elsewhere. There was no sign of movement anywhere, and no noise.

Luke whispered to Austin, “What do you think could possible eat all that?”

“Trolls,” Austin whispered back. “Or something like a Troll. Or rather _six_ of them.”

Luke thought back to the night’s crunching noises, and the stench, and he shuddered. His stomach did some flips. For a moment he thought he was going to barf. “We should get out of here, get back to the road.”

“Yeah. Let’s hurry.”

As quickly and quietly as they were able they put their things into their bags. They looked both ways, then went slinking off toward the road. Austin kept the stopwatch in his hand at the ready, should they run into anything Troll-like.

They made it to the road without running into anything concerning, then followed the compass again. The morning was cool, with dew on the leaves of the trees, and a fresh sent of pine in the air. They walked quickly, aware of every bird, squirrel, and lizard that flapped, scampered, and scurried as they walked past. After a mile or so they relaxed a bit. It seemed nothing was chasing them. 

After walking for a little more than an hour they came to a fork in the road. They looked at the compass, which seemed to be telling them to take a left. Just to be sure they started walking to the right. Not only did the compass needle spin wildly toward the left, Luke was sure he felt the compass actually _pull_ that way a bit. They went left.

They walked another mile or so. It was an easy section of road; mostly flat, with few turns. They were talking about having a break to eat some breakfast when they noticed some sort of clearing up ahead. They decided to investigate before eating.

As they got closer they realized that what they were seeing wasn’t so much a clearing as the forest’s edge. Beyond the border a great valley seemed to stretch far ahead of them. It looked like there were mountains in the distance, but the morning was hazy; it was hard to say what it was they were seeing that far off.

They continued down the road and noticed what seemed to be scattering of grey boulders. It was only when they were nearly upon them that they realize that these weren’t rocks but _buildings_. This was some kind of small village. 

They talked it over and decided to investigate rather than avoid the village. At this point it seemed that anything intelligent enough to make a village was probably less dangerous than the things they had already survived. Still, just to be safe, Austin had the stopwatch ready in his hand. 

Luke showed the compass to Austin; it seemed to be directing them to the closest building to the edge of the forest. They made their way there, listening to any sign of life.

The building was about 9 feet high, and 20 feet square. On the far side they found a wooden door and a few windows. The windows were too dirty to see though, so peaked through the doorway, over a pile of sticks that had been built up as a barrier.

They pushed the sticks away and stepped inside. It was very dark, and it took their eyes a moment to adjust. Luke saw a small box on the opposite wall and started toward it, when he nearly tripped over something on the ground. He looked down and realized what it was that he tripped on.  He couldn’t believe his eyes. He looked at Austin. Austin was staring, slack jawed.

There, on the ground, were two humans, asleep.
