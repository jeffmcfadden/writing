# Every day a funeral

<br />Every day
<br />a funeral
<br />hidden in my heart
<br />
<br />Every day
<br />reminded of 
<br />the you I used to know
<br />
<br />No gravesite
<br />No plaque
<br />No headstone
<br />No flowers
<br />No songs
<br />No slides
<br />No reminiscing
<br />No hugs
<br />No closure
<br />
<br />All I have are open wounds
<br />And broken promises
<br />Grief unmeasured
<br />A hypothermic soul 
<br />
<br />Your body now an apparition
<br />Haunting all the air I breathe
<br />Your heart still beats
<br />But the you I knew is no more
